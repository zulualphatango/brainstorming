ideas about future projects

name: relay information from photo
tag: quality of life 
description: 
  purpose: memorizing all the available relays is pure waste of time,
  the shelves (all?) have a list with the symbols, although scanned materials are available 
  it might be a nice quality of life improvement to just make a photo with smartphone and have all
  relevant info at hand
  
  subtasks: 
  -symbol recognition 95%+ accuracy (60-70 class, easy to get data with smartphone videos
  -scanned infos
  
  optional subtasks
  -show symbols in a list, commonly searched symbols at top,
  maybe fast reach part differentiated from the all list
  -processed texts with OCR
  -searchable by names, tags maybe or just plain search function
