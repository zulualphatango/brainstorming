# brainstorming  
ideas about future projects  

name: relay information from photo  
tag: quality of life improvement  
description:  
  purpose: memorizing all the available relays is pure waste of time,  
  the shelves (all?) have a list with the symbols, although scanned materials are available  
  it might be a nice quality of life improvement to just make a photo with smartphone and have all  
  relevant info at hand  
    
  subtasks:  
  -symbol recognition 95%+ accuracy (60-70 class, easy to get data with smartphone videos)  
  -scan descriptions/ relevant infos  
    
  optional subtasks  
  -show symbols in a list, commonly searched symbols at top,  
  maybe fast reach part differentiated from the all list  
  -processed texts with OCR  
  -searchable by names, tags maybe or just plain search function  
usefulness: questionable, only if I specialize for relay networks/ I commonly get the task  
  commonly used? 2/3 (1 yes, 2 so-so, 3 no)  
  saved time: couple of minutes

name: relay network visualisation  
tag: qualaty of life improvement  
description:  
  purpose: the used relay network is huge, most(?) of the network is using standardized shelves,  
  connections, depencies makes it difficult to grasp that which shelf is connected to what, making  
  finding errors complicated. A simple visualizition, a sort of interactive network map might be useful  
  
  subtasks
  -automatize the processing of 200(?) pages of a book  
  input is a photo of the circuit, output is the depencies to other selves 
  -search function for shelves
  -gui for results
usefulness: questionable, only if I specialize for relay networks/ I commonly get the task  
  commonly used? 2/3 (1 yes, 2 so-so, 3 no)  
  saved time: couple of minutes
